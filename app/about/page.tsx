                Hi! Iâ€™m Davide Ludovici, a passionate self-taught web developer.
                Ever since I was a child, I have dreamed of becoming a
                programmer, especially a video game developer. This dream led me
                to pursue an IT education, but despite not completing my
                studies, my passion for programming never waned.

                {`After earning a diploma in accounting, I worked for many years
                as a Healthcare Assistant (OSS), assisting disabled patients.
                This work was very fulfilling, but I always felt the absence of
                my original dream. So, I decided to roll up my sleeves and study
                programming on my own.`}

                yet worked formally in the web development field, I am eager to
                seize opportunities to prove myself. I love exploring new
                technologies and continue to learn every day, driven by my
                belief that "if you don't struggle, you don't learn."`}

              video series from The Coding Train was miraculous. In addition to
              the basics, I rediscovered the fun of programming.
